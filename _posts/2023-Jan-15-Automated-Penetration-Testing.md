This is an example of a post which includes code, quotes and backtick.

- Recent RL has demonstrated human-exceeding perform in XXXX
- PT involve massive human effort
- Meanwhile, PT can be formalized or modelled as sequential decision making problem, which naturally suitable for RL

Backgrounds
> There are many works that attempts to use RL methods solve PT to reduce human efforts

- Attack Graph methods
  
"I think probably we need a sub-section to introduce *Nasim*, which is widely used in this area.

Methods
- PDDL
- RL:
  - Large Action Space


Limitations
- Large Action Space
- Partially Observable 
- Defensive Mechanisms

Most importantly, how to applied RL learned policy in real scenario

> 2. How we weaponize pen-testing tools using python scripts
>  Anyway, I was not sure how incooperate `Att&Ck` framework here
